### Bio  
I got into programming making Flash games c. 2010. (RIP Flash ðŸ˜ž)  
I got degrees in Mathematics and Geoscience in 2014 at Trinity University, San Antonio TX.  
I use Python for personal interest projects, and C++/Qt for larger projects.  

### FastGrav  
FastGrav is geophysical software package I created using C++/Qt. It is free to use on Mac/PC. Download, view documentation, and watch videos of FastGrav in action at [FastGrav.com](http://www.fastgrav.com).  
FastGrav is used to forward-model microgravity anomalies from 3-dimensional subterranean bodies. The magnitude of gravity (~9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>) actually varies minutely from location to location, and the structure and density of geological masses under the ground have significant impact on these variations. FastGrav allows the user to construct a 2D or 3D model and calculate and plot variations in gravity at the ground surface.  
  
### Personal Interest Projects  
I include here several of my favorite personal interest projects from the last couple years.
- Spotify projects: Playlist creation and manipulation using Python and the Spotify API.
- Coinbase Pro projects: Automated trading and market info dashboards using Python or C++ and the Coinbase Pro API.
- Arduino Heliostat: A [heliostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliostat) coded for Arduino/C++.

### Non-code Miscellaneous
- I have a side business [selling math socks](https://www.socktheory.store).
- I also do ceramics in my free time.
- Favorite videogames: The Witness, Obduction, Baba is You, Outer Wilds.
- Favorite books: The Three-Body Problem, Till We Have Faces, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle.
